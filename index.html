			   your mask on, before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.</p>
			<h3>Keep good hygiene</h3>
			<p>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with either an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
				 This eliminates germs that may be on your hands, including viruses.</p>
			<h3>Make your environment safer</h3>
			<p>Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close contact.Meet people outside.

		  <h2 class="margin"><b>FAQS</b></h2>
		  <h3><b>What is COVID-19?</b></h3>
		  <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms,
			   but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of
			    illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new,
				 returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being 
				 infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical 
				 conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.</p>
		  <h3><b>Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect myself?</b></h3>
		  <p>Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your 
				hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; 
				going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an 
				alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol</p>
		  <h3><b>What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?</b></h3>
		  <p>People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms – from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 
			  2-14 days after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19.</p>

			Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases 
			such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). COVID-19 is caused by a 
			coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans (SARS-CoV-2). To find out more, watch this short video 
			which was revised on 15 June 2020 to reflect the evolving context.
